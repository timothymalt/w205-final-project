Final Papers (Week 15)
The final paper will be very brief. You must include the URL for the final version of the project web site and a breakdown of which group members undertook which tasks. Include any additional information you would like your instructor to be aware of, changes you would have made if you had more time, such as information you didn't have time to include in the final presentation or changes you made in the last week, since the in-class demo. Here is a sample final paper.
